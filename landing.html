				<br>
				<p>	Since the age of 15, Stephen has sought out leadership roles that would help him advance his set of skills.  Starting as a shooting instructor for the Boy Scouts of America, he mentored his contemporaries both on and off the archery range.   As a natural born leader, he was able to counsel and teach life skills.   He used this chance to become a role model and friend to the other boys, an opportunity he truly enjoyed.</p>
					<p>Stephen advanced quickly and by the time he was 18, was promoted manager of his own archery range.  After successfully overseeing his post for a period of two years, he felt a strong desire to give back to others by serving overseas for his church. </p>
					<p>While serving in Africa, he was instrumental in the development of an entirely new mission when the country of Botswana became religiously independent from South Africa. 
					Furthermore, his leadership experience proved useful as he took on the role of the mission’s fleet coordinator, managing more than 50 vehicles over an area roughly the size of Texas.</p>  
					<p> Adapting to life in a 3rd world country opened his mind to new ways of living and thinking.  This was fundamental in the development of his appreciation for life and the viewpoint he has in nearly every situation.</p>
					
					<p>Upon returning to the states he went back to the stressful world of shooting sports as a senior range director by simultaneously managing an archery range, rifle range and shotgun range.  Meanwhile he also managed and orchestrated 5 educational wilderness courses for youth.</p>
					
					<p>Because of his affinity for computer technology and a desire to further his education, he enrolled in the University of Utah’s coding bootcamp. </p>
					<p>Upon learning of a challenge in his learning style and ability, he completely adjusted to another way that made it easier for him.  The journey through this course had many trials and a few extenuating circumstances but always determined to succeed in his endeavors, he retaught himself how to learn and adapted to a situation that others would find discouraging.   Despite the initial difficulties he has developed a love for CSS and the design process. His development skills cover a wide range of languages in which enable him to design and build full stack applications from start to finish!</p>
						
					<p>Stephen currently lives in Utah County with his wife Madeline and daughter Valerie, where he hopes to establish a long and productive career in software engineering.
